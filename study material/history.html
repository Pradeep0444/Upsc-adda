        1. Advent of Europeans and Consolidation of British Power
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Portuguese were the first ones to come, but it was the British who
        were able to capture vast Indian territories and make themselves the
        leading power of the industrial age.
      </p>
      <h3>Why Europeans Wanted to Come to India</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To re-establish direct contact between Europeans and Indians and
          reduce dependence on Arab Muslim intermediaries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Easy accessibility to Indian commodities like spices, calicoes, silk,
          and precious stones, which were in high demand worldwide.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Spirit of the Renaissance, combined with advances in Shipbuilding,
          and Navigation, made all Europeans eager to explore the seas and reach
          the East.
        </li>
        <li>
          During this period in Europe, economic development advanced rapidly in
          many regions.
        </li>
        <li>
          This economic prosperity heightened the demand for oriental luxury
          goods, particularly spices used for cooking and preservation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Portuguese</h3>
      <h4>Why did The Portuguese Become The First To Reach India?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Portugal had assumed leadership of Christendom in its resistance
          against Islam, thus they wanted to expand their domination across
          geographies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prince Henry of Portugal, also known as the ‘Navigator’ was given a
          bull by Pope Nicholas V in 1454, conferring on him the right to
          explore the oriental shores as far as India.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 1497, pursuant to the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), Portugal and
          Spain divided the non-Christian world by an imaginary line in the
          Atlantic, 1,300 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands. Portugal was
          granted the right to claim and occupy territories to the east of the
          line, while Spain could do so for territories to the west. This
          division set the stage for Portuguese ventures into the waters around
          India.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 1487, Bartholomew Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope and sailed up
          the eastern coast of Africa, mistaking it to be India. However, it was
          in May 1498, that the Portuguese finally landed in India.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Chronology of Important Portuguese Figures in India</h4>
      <p><strong>Vasco Da Gama</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Arrived in India in 1498, led by a Gujarati pilot named Abdul Majid,
          and got a friendly reception from the Zamorin (ruler of Calicut),
          through which he was able to gain huge profits from the pepper trade.
        </li>
        <li>
          Came to India again in 1501 and set up a trading factory at Cannanore.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Vasco Da Gama visited India three times - 1498, 1501, and 1524. He died
        in Cochin in 1524, three months after his arrival.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Pedro Alvarez Cabral</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          He embarked on a voyage to trade for spices and established a factory
          in Calicut in September 1500.
        </li>
        <li>
          Conflict arose when the Portuguese factory in Calicut was attacked,
          leading to casualties among the Portuguese. In retaliation, Cabral
          seized Arab merchant ships, causing significant loss of life,
          confiscating cargo, and burning the ships. Calicut was bombarded by
          Cabral.
        </li>
        <li>
          Despite the conflict, Cabral later successfully negotiated favorable
          treaties with local rulers in Cochin and Cannanore.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Francisco De Almeida</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In 1505, the King of Portugal appointed Francisco De Almeida as
          governor of India.
        </li>
        <li>
          Almeida’s mission was to consolidate the Portuguese presence in India
          and establish strong trade networks.
        </li>
      </ul>
