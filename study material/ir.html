        <h3>The Company Rule (1773–1858)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Regulating Act of 1773</strong><br>
            The first step taken by the British Government was to control and regulate the affairs of the East India Company in India. It laid the foundations of central administration in India. It recognized, for the first time, the political and administrative functions of the Company. It designated the Governor of Bengal as the ‘Governor-General of Bengal’ and created an Executive Council of four members to assist him. The first such Governor-General was Lord Warren Hastings. It established a Supreme Court at Calcutta (1774) comprising one chief justice and three other judges. It prohibited the servants of the Company from engaging in any private trade or accepting presents or bribes from the Natives. It strengthened the control of the British Government over the Company by requiring the Court of Directors (the governing body of the Company) to report on its revenue, civil, and military affairs in India. It made the governors of Bombay and Madras presidencies subordinate to the Governor General of Bengal, unlike earlier, when the three presidencies were independent of one another.
        </p>
        <h3>Amending Act of 1781 (Act of Settlement)</h3>
        <p>
            It exempted the Governor-General and the Council from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court for the acts carried out by them in their official capacity. It excluded the revenue matters and the matters arising in the collection of revenue from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. It provided that the Supreme Court was to have jurisdiction over all the inhabitants of Calcutta and the Court to administer the personal law of the defendants i.e., Hindus were to be tried according to the Hindu law, and Muslims were to be tried according to the Mohammedan law. The appeals from the Provincial Courts could be taken to the Governor-General-in-Council and not to the Supreme Court. It empowered the Governor-General-in-Council to frame regulations for the Provincial Courts and Councils.
        </p>
        <h3>Pitt’s India Act, 1784</h3>
        <p>
            It distinguished between the commercial and political functions of the Company. It established a system of Double government. A new Board of Control to manage the political affairs, also supervise and direct all operations of the civil and military government or revenues of the British possessions in India. Court of Directors to manage the commercial affairs; hence distinguishing between its commercial and political functions. The company’s territories in India were, for the first time, called the ‘British possessions in India’. So, the British Government was given supreme control over the Company’s affairs and its administration in India,
        </p>
        <h3>Act of 1786</h3>
        <p>
            Lord Cornwallis was appointed as the Governor-General of Bengal and also Commander-in-Chief. He was given the power to override the decision of his council in special cases.
        </p>
        <h3>Charter Act of 1793</h3>
        <p>
            Extended the overriding power given to Lord Cornwallis over his council, to all future Governors-General and Governors of Presidencies. Gave the Governor-General more powers and control over the governments of the subordinate Presidencies of Bombay and Madras. Extended the trade monopoly of the Company in India for another period of twenty years. Provisions were made so that the Commander-in-Chief was not to be a member of the Governor-General’s council unless he was so appointed. It laid down that the members of the Board of Control and their staff were, henceforth, to be paid out of the Indian revenues.

      <h3>The Crown Rule (1858–1947)</h3>
      <p>
          <!-- Content extracted from the PDF -->
          <strong>Government of India Act of 1858</strong><br>
          This Act abolished the East India Company, and transferred the powers of government, territories, and revenues to the British Crown. It created the office of the Secretary of State for India, vested with complete authority and control over Indian administration. The Secretary of State was a member of the British Cabinet and was responsible ultimately to the British Parliament. The Secretary of State was assisted by a Council of 15 members (known as the Council of India). He was the channel of communication between the British Government in Britain and the Indian administration. The Governor-General was made the Viceroy of India. He (Viceroy) was the direct representative of the British Crown in India.
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>Indian Councils Act of 1861</strong><br>
          It introduced a significant change in the composition of the Governor-General’s council. It provided that the Governor-General’s Executive Council, which was composed exclusively of officials, should include certain non-official members also. The non-official members were to be nominated by the Governor-General. The Act initiated the process of decentralization by restoring the legislative powers to the Bombay and Madras Presidencies. It thus reversed the centralizing tendency that had been set in motion by the Charter Act of 1833. The Act also provided for the establishment of new legislative councils for Bengal, North-Western Provinces, and Punjab, which were established in 1862, 1886, and 1897 respectively.
